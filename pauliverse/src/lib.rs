//! Fast stabilizer simulation for quantum error correction research.
//!
//! `pauliverse` provides multiple stabilizer simulation implementations, each optimized
//! for different use cases in quantum computing and quantum error correction.
//!
//! These simulation algorithms are based on the framework described in
//! [arXiv:2309.08676](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08676), extended with exact
//! global-phase tracking from [arXiv:2603.24717](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.24717).
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This crate offers five simulation modes:
//!
//! - **[`OutcomeSpecificSimulation`]**: Traditional simulation with random (or caller-supplied) measurement outcomes.
//!   Best for Monte Carlo sampling and estimating error rates.
//!
//! - **[`OutcomeCompleteSimulation`]**: Tracks all possible measurement outcomes simultaneously.
//!   Achieves asymptotic speedup when enumerating outcomes.
//!
//! - **[`PhasedOutcomeCompleteSimulation`]**: Like [`OutcomeCompleteSimulation`], but additionally
//!   tracks the *exact* global phase of the encoded state (Algorithm 4.2 of
//!   [arXiv:2603.24717](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.24717)). Enables exact equality checking of
//!   non-stabilizer circuits.
//!
//! - **[`OutcomeFreeSimulation`]**: Simulation without tracking specific outcomes.
//!   Minimal overhead when you only care about stabilizer state evolution up to global phase.
//!
//! - **[`FaultySimulation`]**: Noisy simulation, combining outcome-complete simulation with
//!   Pauli frame propagation.
//!
//! All simulators implement the [`Simulation`] trait.
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```
//! use pauliverse::{OutcomeSpecificSimulation, Simulation};
//! use paulimer::{UnitaryOp, SparsePauli};
//!
//! // Create a simple Bell state simulation
//! let mut sim = OutcomeSpecificSimulation::new_with_random_outcomes(2);
//!
//! // Apply gates
//! sim.unitary_op(UnitaryOp::Hadamard, &[0]);
//! sim.unitary_op(UnitaryOp::ControlledX, &[0, 1]);
//!
//! // Measure
//! let observable: SparsePauli = "ZI".parse().unwrap();
//! let outcome = sim.measure(&observable);
//! ```
//!
//! # Choosing a Simulator
//!
//! All simulators have worst-case complexity `O(n_gates × n_qubits²)`, though actual cost
//! depends on circuit composition.
//!
//! | Simulator | Best For | Key Advantage |
//! |-----------|----------|---------------|
//! | [`OutcomeSpecificSimulation`] | Monte Carlo sampling with few shots | Single concrete execution path |
//! | [`OutcomeCompleteSimulation`] | Whole-circuit analysis, enumerating outcomes | Avoids re-simulating for each outcome sample |
//! | [`PhasedOutcomeCompleteSimulation`] | Exact equality checking of non-stabilizer circuits | Tracks the exact global phase, not just up to phase |
//! | [`OutcomeFreeSimulation`] | Stabilizer queries without outcomes | Minimal overhead, no outcome tracking |
//! | [`FaultySimulation`] | Noisy simulation with error correction | Efficient frame-based noise propagation |
//!
//! **When to use outcome-complete over outcome-specific**: If you need many samples and the
//! circuit has `n_random` random measurements, outcome-complete saves a factor of `n_random` by computing
//! the outcome distribution once, then sampling efficiently without re-running the circuit.
//! Outcome-complete simulation is also ideal for circuit characterizations, like verification or outcome codes.
//!
//! # Performance Features
//!
//! - **SIMD acceleration**: Via [`binar`] for bit matrix operations
//! - **Cache alignment**: For efficient memory access
//! - **Batch processing**: Simulate millions of shots with minimal overhead
//! - **Amortized enumeration**: [`OutcomeCompleteSimulation`] pays circuit cost once,
//!   then permits enumeration of outcomes without re-simulating.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Built on [`paulimer`] for Pauli and Clifford operations, which in turn uses
//! [`binar`] for efficient bit matrix operations.
//!
//! The simulation algorithms implement the general form representation described in
//! the paper, allowing efficient tracking of measurement outcomes and their correlations
//! with stabilizer states. This enables verification of stabilizer circuits by
//! exhaustively characterizing their behavior across all possible measurement outcomes.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Optional cargo features:
//! - `python`: Python bindings (included with paulimer Python package)
//!
//! # See Also
//!
//! - [`paulimer`]: Pauli and Clifford algebra primitives
//! - [`binar`]: Efficient bit vector and matrix operations

    /// conditioned on the returned outcome (e.g. `conditional_pauli(P, &[angle], true)`). It behaves
    /// like a random bit during simulation, but it carries different *provenance*: symbolic angles
    /// model the (unknown) continuous parameters of a circuit, whereas [`Self::allocate_random_bit`]
    /// models genuine measurement randomness.
    ///
    /// Simulators that track this distinction (such as the phased outcome-complete simulator) use it
    /// to require that symbolic angles correspond one-to-one between circuits being compared, while
    /// genuine random bits may be affinely remapped. The default implementation simply defers to
    /// [`Self::allocate_random_bit`], so simulators that do not track provenance are unaffected.
